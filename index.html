    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img id="image" src="https://media.licdn.com/media/p/2/000/19d/213/1ef8a4a.jpg" width="175" height="175">
    <p>I was born on Mathor Air Force Base in Sacromento California. With my dad in the military and mom something of a nomad, I moved around a lot
       I am the oldest of my mother's 5 and my father's 6, but if you count all of the adopted and step-siblings have 15 brothers and sisters.
       I have 3 children of my own, all girls, and all growing up to be very beautiful young women.</p>
    <p>I went to many different schools growing up, 3 different ones for my freshman year of highschools. I was finally able to settle and focus on my
       grades when i was put into fostercare in the 9th grade. I was lucky enough to finaly get the grade I would need in order to be able to go to college </p>

    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>I graduated from DeVry University in 1999 with a Bachlors in Computer Information Systems.
       I worked as a programmer at Honeywell for a short time until a layoff in late 2001. Since that time I have had many jobs in IT departments
       doing many differnt IT rolls. But I have not had another programming job.</p>

    <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
    <p>When I was in highschool my plan was to be a Highschool math and computer teacher, I did not want to go the traditional route though.
       Instead of majoring in secondary education I had decided it would be more benificial for both myself and the students to major in computers.
       Then when I started school and had my first programming class, I decided "This is what I want to do with my life!"</p>
    <p>I have decided to learn programming again through Coder Camps because I have not been continually programming throughout my career.
       Since I have been doing other rolls in IT I am behind on the needed languages and technology that I need in order to get back to programming.
       I want to go back to doing what I had chosen my career path to be when I had taken that first programming class</p>
